Frametime - my LD33 entry

Controls:
* Arrows to turn your plane
* L1/R1 to strafe
* X to rocket boost
* Square to shoot
* Start to restart the level

You will probably not be able to get up to a level that has blatant performance issues as the difficulty ramps up severely.

Code and scripts are MIT-licensed (see LICENCE.md) EXCEPT tools/iso2raw.c which is a modified mashup of two pieces of code and is in an unknown state. It is provided because it is VERY USEFUL.

rawcga.bin is the IBM CGA ROM font.

rawhead2.bin is a PAL CD-ROM header. It is required for PS1 development and ultimately cannot be replaced.
