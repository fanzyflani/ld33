This is my personal toolchain for developing PS1 code.

Code and scripts are in the public domain.

rawcga.bin is the IBM CGA ROM font.

s2-cez.s3m is my cover of Crystal Egg Zone from Sonic 2 Master System. Please ask before using this in your own projects. (But I really don't care if you use it as a placeholder while testing things.)
